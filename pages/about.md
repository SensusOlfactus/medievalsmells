## Odors and the Sense of Smell in Medieval Europe

In medieval Europe, a sweet scent was a sure way to recognize the holiness of a person, a place, or an object. 
Church ritual, particularly the mass, was from early times perfumed with incense as a sign that the work of God was being done. 
Additionally, in hagiography, saints were recognized by their miraculously pleasant scent after death, the odor of sanctity. 
Both texts and artworks refer, often quietly but nevertheless insistently, to the role of the olfactory sense in medieval life. 
Scholars have only recently begun to acknowledge the role of the sense of smell in medieval European thought. 
Odors in art are particularly easy to overlook. 
For example, angels carrying censers often (perhaps even ‘usually’) form a part of images of Christ, Mary, and the saints as an extra marker of the sanctity of the main figure. 
Angels with censers are ubiquitous in medieval art, but they attract little comment apart from the fact of their existence. 
Yet the artists would not have bothered to include them if they were not meaningful. 
Flowers, particularly roses and lilies, are likewise so common in medieval art as to not attract much interest. 
The research that has been done on them rarely considers the effect of the flowers’ scents, despite the fact that in written sources reveal medieval people strongly associated flowers with their fragrance—sometimes more than with their appearance. 
Medieval Christian art depicts invisible odors, both pleasant and foul, with signs of scent such as incense burners, flowers, or the reactions of figures to an invisible odor. 
Aroma forms as important a part of the narrative of medieval art as a reference to the odor of sanctity or to a plague-causing stench does in textual sources.

### The Collection

The collection here currently includes only a small sampling of some of the ways that odor was represented in medieval art. 
[Censing angels](https://sensusolfactus.github.io/medievalsmells/item.html?id=smell001) is just one example of the extremely common motif of angels swinging censers near a depiction of Christ. 
The *bas-de-page* illustrations in the Taymouth Hours ([1](https://sensusolfactus.github.io/medievalsmells/item.html?id=smell002), [2](https://sensusolfactus.github.io/medievalsmells/item.html?id=smell003)) give an example of the significance of flowers in medieval art and literature. 
The two illustrations tell the story of “The Monk who Only Knew the Ave Maria,” which is a tale from the *Miracles of the Virgin*, a collection of legends regarding miracles performed by the Virgin Mary. 
The monk in the story was so simple that the only prayer he could learn was the *Ave Maria*. 
The other monks looked down on him for his stupidity, but when he died, a flower grew from his mouth that signified his closeness with Mary. 
The lilies in the second illustration are symbolic of virginity in general and of Mary in particular. 
The sweet scent of the lily is a feature of nearly every textual description of the flower. 
Moreover, prayers are said to rise as a sweet odor to God, just as incense or a burnt offering might do. 
Therefore, the lilies in the monk’s mouth signify the pleasing odor of his simple prayers. 
[Panther](https://sensusolfactus.github.io/medievalsmells/item.html?id=smell004) and [Whale](https://sensusolfactus.github.io/medievalsmells/item.html?id=smell005) are two examples of bestiary figures that are strongly associated with their good-smelling breath. 
The two images of St. Louis ([1](https://sensusolfactus.github.io/medievalsmells/item.html?id=smell006), [2](https://sensusolfactus.github.io/medievalsmells/item.html?id=smell007)) and the [copy of Raphael’s work](https://sensusolfactus.github.io/medievalsmells/item.html?id=smell008) depict the stench of death, which Galenic-Arabic medicine taught was a cause of disease from ancient times until the nineteenth century. 
Finally, Andreas Vesalius’s anatomical drawings of the brain ([1](https://sensusolfactus.github.io/medievalsmells/item.html?id=smell009), [2](https://sensusolfactus.github.io/medievalsmells/item.html?id=smell010)) depict changes in the scientific understanding of where the olfactory organs were located by the middle of the sixteenth century. 

#### Avenues for Future Research

Olfaction and odor are as present in medieval art as they are in medieval texts. 
Odor might appear in many guises, depending on the requirements of the story and the limitations of the medium.
However, there are a few common olfactory elements to look for in medieval art: 

- figures with censers
- flowers, especially roses and lilies
- bestiary creatures, especially the panther, the whale, and the phoenix
- figures reacting to odor, especially of corpses
- figures pointing to their noses or smelling flowers (e.g., the early medieval English [Fuller brooch](https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/H_1952-0404-1)) 

Certain persons, places, or things might be considered odorous at all times, such as saints, flowers, fires or anything burning, the heavenly Jerusalem, heaven, and hell. 
There is also a lot of work to be done on scientific depictions of odor and olfaction.
